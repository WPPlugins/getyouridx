Give your clients quick and easy access to Real Estate listings by way of Internet Data Exchange with GetYourIDX.com

Internet Data Exchange (IDX) is the most efficient way for Brokers to develop relationships between Realtors when facilitating the purchase and sale of real estate property. This technology gives Multiple Listing Services (MLS) participants the essential tools needed to display each others' clients on their prospective Internet Web sites. Under the IDX real estate system, brokers agree to display each others listings on the internet and are provided the option of what listings they want displayed.

Our affordable, easy to use Internet Data Exchange Service for your Web site is industry standard tested. We guarantee to return all IDX queries within 1 second, making us the fastest performing service of its kind in the nation. If your current IDX provider runs slow and bogs down in its searches, consider switching to GetYourIDX.com
